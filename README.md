# Screenshotter
Screenshots your desktop on regular intervals, complies them into an Imgur album,
and then emails it to you. Or, simply saves them to your hard drive.

Can be used to get a slideshow of your day, or 20 pictures of the same spreadsheet
or Reddit window. Regardless, the frequency at which pictures are taken, the album 
size, and most other parameters can be changed in the Screenshotter class.

The Mailer class contains hardcoded email addresses, containing a throwaway Yahoo address.
Use with other types of emails will require changing the information for mail servers. 
Your own login.txt file must be supplied with email credentials, of the given form.
